## ‚ú® Project Overview
This project explores the application of NoSQL databases, specifically **UnQLite**, in managing restaurant data for platforms like **Uber Eats, Zomato, Swiggy**, etc. The project provided hands-on experience in handling NoSQL databases to store, retrieve, and process restaurant-related information efficiently.

## üìö Reflection
### Key Steps:
1. **Technology Stack Exploration**:
   - Programming Language: Python
   - NoSQL Database: UnQLite
   - Python Libraries: `math` module (`radians`, `sin`, `cos`, `atan2`), and error handling techniques.

2. **Project Execution**:
   - Analyzed the structure of the database collection using the commands:
     ```python
     from unqlite import UnQLite
     db = UnQLite('sample.db')
     data = db.collection('data')
     ```
   - Implemented and optimized functions for data processing:
     - **FindBusinessBasedOnCity**: Filters businesses based on city.
     - **FindBusinessBasedOnLocation**: Filters businesses based on their proximity to a location.
     - **DistanceFunction**: Calculates the distance between two geographical points.

3. **Testing**:
   - Verified functionality using test cases.
   - Captured outputs in files: `output_city` and `output_loc`.

## üöÄ Key Functionalities

### 1. `FindBusinessBasedOnCity`
- **Purpose**: Filters businesses based on the provided city name.
- **Implementation**:
  - Opened the output file (`save_location`) in write mode.
  - Iterated through the collection to find matching cities.
  - Stored matching business details (`name$full_address$city$state`) in the file.

### 2. `FindBusinessBasedOnLocation`
- **Purpose**: Filters businesses based on proximity to a given latitude, longitude, and categories.
- **Implementation**:
  - Checked for category intersections between input and document data.
  - Calculated distances using the `DistanceFunction`.
  - Stored business names within the specified distance in the output file.

### 3. `DistanceFunction`
- **Purpose**: Computes distance between two geographical points using the Haversine formula.

## üìù Lessons Learned
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented robust error handling to manage exceptions like `None` values and missing data.
2. **Data Validation**:
   - Ensured efficient handling of `None` and invalid values in the dataset.
3. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Learned how NoSQL databases like **UnQLite** efficiently store and retrieve restaurant data for applications.
4. **UnQLite Functionalities**:
   - Explored commands to read, write, and manipulate collections.
5. **Python Optimization**:
   - Improved function implementations by minimizing time and space complexities.
6. **Math Module**:
   - Utilized Python's `math` module for geospatial calculations (`radians`, `sin`, `cos`, `atan2`).
